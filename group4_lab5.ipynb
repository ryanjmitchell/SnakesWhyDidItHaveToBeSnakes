    "I know it seems like just yesterday you were struggling with \"what is a notebook? what is github? how do I `import arcgis`??\" But, that's the nature of the quarter system and here we are, ready to start putting things all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember the core goals of this class, they're to help you programmatically:\n",
    "1. Get some data.\n",
    "2. Format, process, analyze, etc. said data.\n",
    "3. Visualize it in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've done so primarily through the ArcGIS API for Python **and** more recently, GeoPandas and Folium. In this lab, we're going to **acquire** data from Twitter (a robust, well developed API that spits out a lot of data), process it into a format that's easy to map (in this case, I recommend a csv), and then add it to a series of interactive maps. \n",
    "\n",
    "As this is your second to last lab, I'm going to leave open precisely how you do a lot of this; however, I'm also going to be working more directly with each group throughout the process. What I mean here is that I recommend you use Folium for your visualization, but you can use the ArcGIS API if you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In fact, you can and should mix and match whatever _tools_ work best for your group.** After this class, you'll encounter many problems - use the core ideas and tools you've encountered in this class to cobble together clever solutions! Iteration! Flow control! Using libraries and reading documentation are the keys to solving a vast, vast variety of geospatial problems.\n"

You can [read about that all here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access).\n",

There are steps at the [developers page](https://developer.twitter.com) that walk you through this, but *for now* know that you'll need a: Consumer Key, a Consumer Secret Key, an Access Token, and an Access Token Secret. \n",

You always want to remove private information before you upload, but these are basic level open information and it's just easiest for this class right now.\n",

    "A brief note on data binding: Although you are (most likely) using the Streaming API, the data in your maps is 'static.' What I mean is that once you create the map, you don't add data to it. There are ways to add data on the fly. In Esri environments, you do so with the [GeoEvent Server](http://www.esri.com/arcgis/products/geoevent-server). In other environments, you can use javascript frameworks such as [angular.js](https://angularjs.org/). Feel free to *experiment* with either. I might look at these guides [here](https://codehandbook.org/creating-a-web-app-using-angularjs-python-mongodb/) and [here](https://medium.com/@peregringaret/a-different-stack-angular-flask-mongodb-780b44e10afd) which use [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) to create a web 'stack.'\n",

    "Is all of that too much? No worries! That's why it's optional. Some of you are going to dive into python and swim within its majesty; others of you are going to learn the basics in order to create and deploy specific solutions or to test particular questions. **Either or both are fine!** The point of this class has never been to make you a programmer, but rather to teach you to *think computationally*, so that you can pursue programming and automation *as far as you need to*. You **can** go out and learn Flask on your own if you need to now, and that's awesome!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, with that out of the way, let's get onto your next question...\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script that prompts the user for a keyword. Then, it monitors that keyword until 100 geocodable tweets have been gathered. Finally, it creates and saves an html map (the name is whatever keyword was chosen - \\[keyword].html where the tweets are clustered at small scales and, at large scales, are points that when clicked upon Give the username and text of the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is *similar* to the solution to **Question 2**; however, it adds a number of additional tasks."
